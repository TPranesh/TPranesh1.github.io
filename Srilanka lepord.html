        <p>Leopards (Panthera pardus) are widely distributed across various national parks and wildlife reserves in Sri Lanka. Bellow are descriptions of three prominent venues where leopards are found in the country:</p>
        <br>

        <ol>
            <li>
            <h2>Yala National Park</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Location: Situated in the southeastern part of Sri Lanka, Yala National Park is the most well-known and visited wildlife sanctuary in the country.</li>
            <li>Habitat: Yala features diverse ecosystems, including dense jungles, scrublands, and coastal areas. The park's varied landscapes provide an ideal habitat for leopards.</li>
            <li>Leopard Population: Yala is renowned for having one of the highest concentrations of leopards in the world. The park's Block 1 is particularly famous for leopard sightings, and the open terrain makes it easier for visitors to spot these elusive big cats.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h2>Wilpattu National Park</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Location: Located in the northwest of Sri Lanka, Wilpattu National Park is the largest national park in the country.</li>
            <li>Habitat: Wilpattu is characterized by a mix of natural lakes (villus), dense forests, and grasslands. The diverse environment provides suitable conditions for leopards to thrive.</li>
            <li>Leopard Population: Wilpattu is known for its leopard population, and the park's vast landscape allows leopards to roam freely. The lakes and surrounding areas offer excellent opportunities for wildlife enthusiasts to observe these majestic predators.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h2>Horton Plains National Park</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Location: Situated in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, Horton Plains National Park is known for its unique plateau and diverse ecosystems</li>
            <li>Habitat: The park features montane grasslands, cloud forests, and rugged terrain. Despite the challenging landscape, leopards have adapted to this environment.</li>
            <li>Leopard Population: While not as frequently seen as in Yala or Wilpattu, leopards inhabit the Horton Plains, and sightings are possible, especially in areas with good vantage points.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <h1>Threat 1</h1>

            <img src="photos/themes/dead leopard.jpg" class="threatimage1">
            <center><h2><u>Illegal Hunting and Trading</u></h2></center>
            <p class="hunting1">Illegal killing and trading of leopards in Sri Lanka pose a severe threat to the species. Poaching for skins, bones, and body parts, driven by traditional medicine practices, contributes to a decline in leopard populations. Retaliatory killings due to human-wildlife conflicts further intensify the challenges faced by leopards. The consequences include disruptions in ecosystems, population decline, and risks to human safety.</p> 
            <center><h2><u>Mechanisms Taken to Reduce the Threat.</u></h2></center>
            <p class="hunting2">Efforts to combat illegal wildlife trade in Sri Lanka involve a multi-faceted approach. Strict law enforcement is implemented to deter poachers and traffickers, and penalties for engaging in such activities are severe. Conservation organizations work closely with local communities to raise awareness about the importance of leopard conservation and the consequences of wildlife trafficking. Additionally, international collaboration and cooperation contribute to the global fight against illegal wildlife trade.</p>

            <h1><center>Threat 2</center></h1></center>
            <br>
            <img src="photos/lepord graph.jpg" class="threatimage2">
            <center><h2><u>Habitat Loss and Fragmentation </u></h2></center>
            <p class="hunting1">Habitat loss and fragmentation present significant threats to Sri Lankan leopards. Rapid deforestation for agriculture, urbanization, and infrastructure development diminishes the available habitats, forcing leopards into smaller and isolated pockets of land. The consequences include disrupted natural movements, reduced prey availability, and increased human-leopard conflicts.</p> 
            <h2><u>Mechanisms Taken to Reduce the Threat.</u></h2>
            <p class="hunting2">To address these challenges, conservation efforts focus on habitat conservation and sustainable land-use practices. Engaging local communities in conservation initiatives helps create wildlife-friendly landscapes, ensuring the connectivity of habitats. Additionally, the implementation of wildlife corridors and protected areas aids in mitigating the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation. Ongoing monitoring and research contribute to adaptive strategies, striving to secure a sustainable future for leopards in the face of habitat challenges.
